# Keypop Card C++ API

## Introduction

The Keypop Card C++ API is a C++ port of the [Keypop Card Java API](https://github.com/eclipse-keypop/keypop-card-java-api),
which serves as the primary reference implementation. This API provides a set of interfaces and structures aligned with the
[Terminal Card specifications](https://terminal-api.calypsonet.org/specifications/reader-layer/card-api/) proposed by the
[Calypso Networks Association](https://www.calypsonet.org/). The C++ version aims to maintain compatibility and consistency
with the Java version, ensuring adherence to the established specifications.

## Key Features

- Interface-driven design for modularity and extensibility
- Compliance with Calypso Networks Association specifications
- Focus on essential card management, communication, and selection mechanisms
- Foundational layer for building custom card-related applications

## Getting Started

To use the Keypop Card C++ API in your project:

1. Include the relevant headers in your source files
2. Provide concrete implementations of the defined interfaces as per your requirements
3. Build and link your project with the necessary dependencies

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation, including UML diagrams and design guides, is available on the [Keypop website](https://keypop.org/apis/reader-layer/card-api/).
